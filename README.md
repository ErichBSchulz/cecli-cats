# Cecli Atomic Tests

Its very hard to improve what you cannot measure.

Benchmarking enables us to chose the best model for our needs, and configure it to get the best out of it.

As models evolve, so must our tests and our metrics.

Cecli Atomic Tests (Cats) aim to enable us to tune hyper-parameters and cecli settings.

The proposed changes enable approaching a new set of more nuanced questions:

* "Which prompt is best?"
* "How do we get the best performance from a specific model (x model)?"
* "Which tests are best at discriminating certain optimisations?"
